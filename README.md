# quiz

This is a small quiz to test knowledge of Irish colors. Words tested includes:
Ban
Bui
Dearg
Bandearg
Glas
Gorm
Donn
Dubh
Liath
Corcra

words to add eventually:
dath
oraiste
banbhui
banchorcra
liathbhán
liathbhuí 
liathchorcra
and more

I would also like to convert this away from strict english/bearla color meanings and have the quiz offer a color picker or different shade choices.
