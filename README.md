# quiz

This is a small quiz to test knowledge of Irish colors. [You can view it here.](https://deliacodes.github.io/quiz/) Words tested include:
* Ban
* Bui
* Dearg
* Bandearg
* Glas
* Gorm
* Donn
* Dubh
* Liath
* Corcra

words to add eventually:
dath
oraiste
banbhui
banchorcra
liathbhán
liathbhuí 
liathchorcra
and more

I would also like to convert this away from strict english/bearla color meanings and have the quiz offer a color picker or different shade choices.
